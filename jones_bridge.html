    <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: helvetica;">The Jones Bridge was formerly known as the Puente de Espana, crosses the Pasig River and connects Manila's Binondo and Santa Cruz districts with the city's downtown. Today this bridge is considered the oldest in the Philippines. Initially, the bridge, consisting of 7 arched spans, was called Puerto Grande - it was built in 1632 by the Spanish colonialists, and became the first bridge across the Pasig River. It was built of wood and connected the Binondo area with the ancient Intramuros area of Manila, allowing residents to move faster and easier from one part of the city to another. The Jones Bridge is named after the United States legislator William Atkinson Jones, who served as the chairman of the U.S. Insular Affairs.</p>
