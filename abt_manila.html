        Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, has a rich and fascinating history that spans over 400 years. Originally inhabited by the Tagalog people, Manila was already a thriving settlement when the Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century. The Spanish established the city as the capital of the Philippines and built a walled city, known as Intramuros, which still stands as a reminder of Manila's colonial past.
