Built from 1954 to 1958 under the supervision of Filipino architect Fernando H. Ocampo, after the previous structure was flattened in the Second World War, itâ€™s a masterpiece of architecture. Every detailed wall carving, door, panel, portal and even its attractive stained glass has its own story.</p>
